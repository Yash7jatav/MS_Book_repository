# Book Repository API

## Overview

The **Book Repository API** allows users to manage books, create reading lists, and perform CRUD operations on books and users. This system is designed to help users add, search, and update books, as well as manage their reading progress. The API also supports adding books to reading lists and updating the status of the books, such as **Want to Read**, **Reading**, or **Finished**.

## Key Features

## How It Works

- **Users**: Users can register with a unique username and email. Once registered, they can add books to their reading list and manage their book status.
